Codebook for Week 4 Data Cleaning Project
Question 1:
1.  Download zip files to desired directory
      getwd()
      setwd ("E:/Coursera/Data Science/Getting and Cleaning Data/Week 4")   
      temp <- tempfile()
      download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip",temp)

2.  Unzip files relevant to project
     "UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"
     "UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"
     "UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"
     "UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"
     "UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
     "UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
     "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"

3.  Change variable names for ease of use
    y_test to YTrain
    x_test to XTrain


4.  Merge subjects/actions to a test file and a training file
    Two files of YTrain and XTrain

5.  Create a variable, "group" to identify subject as "test" or "train" then merge test and traning files
    group <- c("test")
    XTest1 <- cbind(XTest, group)
    group <- c("training")
    XTrain1 <- cbind(XTrain, group)
    combined <- rbind(XTrain1, XTest1)

Question 2:
1.  Select out variables with string "mean()", "std()", "subjects", "actions", "group"
2.  Combine the variables into a master dataset, "masterdata"

Question 3:
1.  Change numerical coding for activities "actions" to meaningful descriptions
    1  <- "Walking"
    2  <- "Walking Upstairs"
    3  <- "Walking Downstairs"
    4  <- "Sitting"
    5  <- "Standing"
    6  <- "Laying"

Question 4:
1.  Expand acronyms to full word
    "Acc" --> "Accelerator"
    "Mag" --> "Magnitude"
    "Gyro" --> "Gyroscope"
    "t" --> "time"
    "f" --> "frequency"
    "01:30" --> "subject 01:subject 30"

Question 5:
1.  Find mean of all variables by each subject and activity
2.  Save result as .txt file
